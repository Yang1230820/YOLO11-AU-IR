# Lightweight Instance Segmentation for Infrared UAV Detection on Edge Devices
---

## Introduction
YOLO11-AU-IR is a lightweight instance segmentation framework aimed at addressing small, low-contrast UAV detection in infrared imagery under real-time and resource-constrained conditions. Unlike standard bounding-box-based methods, our approach leverages pixel-level segmentation masks to capture fine-grained details of small IR targets, thus improving detection accuracy even in challenging environments.

## Dataset
AUVD-Seg300 is our curated IR UAV dataset with pixel-level segmentation masks. It captures various drone types and flight scenarios, ensuring robust training data for small-target detection in low-contrast IR conditions.
Upon acceptance and official publication of our manuscript, you will be able to download the dataset here, along with usage instructions.
